# A Place of Sharing
{: .fs-9 }

As someone who started out as a beginner in computer science, I know how overwhelming it can be to find the right resources and learning pathway online. Google searches can be helpful, but they often don't lead us to the best resources. It's easy to feel lost and frustrated, but I kept searching, and after two years of effort, I finally discovered a collection of valuable resources that I would like to share with you all.

This collection includes insightful bloggers' sites, inspiring online courses, helpful documentation, engaging discussion threads, and other repositories for sharing resources. I have put together this list in the hopes of saving others time and frustration, and to guide you to the most enjoyable learning experiences and the most fascinating aspects of computer science. I hope these resources will be as helpful to you as they have been to me, and I look forward to your contribution to the list as well!
